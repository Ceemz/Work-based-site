  <h2> <strong> Professional Summary</strong> </h2>
  <p>

    A committed and driven Analytical Scientist with sound understanding and operation of instrumental methods such as UV/Vis Spectrophotometer, Infrared Spectrometer, XRF-EDX, XRF-WDX, ICP-OES, GFAAS, Gas Chromatography (GC), High Performance
    liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Atomic Absorption Spectrometer (AAS), Flame Emission Spectrometer (FES), Melvin Particle size analyser, Surface area and Porosity Analyser and Potentiometer; adept to classic chemical analyses methods ( titrimetric
    and gravimetric methods), adept with the procedure of analysing, interpreting and recording data, as well reporting and
    presenting results obtained in an analysis in a scientific way (Report). Utilizes sound organization and planning skills to deliver assignments within set timeframes and to a high quality standard. Fully understands the importance of working with
    a team and collaborative working with other work related work teams and applies Chemistry principles learned during the period of study when performing analysis and when analysing data. Practices good laboratory skills (GLP), Good manufacturing
    practice (GMP) and understands quality control and assurance in the laboratory. Adheres to deadlines and is always willing to learn something new every day. Understands ISO standards viz. ISO: 17025:2005 and ISO: 9001. Has recently acquired a
    Project management certificate and this has in turn been equipped with the necessary skills to manage and execute small projects. The experience acquired in the pharmaceutical industry includes sound understanding of Pharmacopoeia (viz. BP and
